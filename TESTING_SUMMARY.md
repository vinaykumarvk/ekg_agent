## 🔍 What Was Tested

### 1. API Health Endpoint
- ✅ Server starts without crashing
- ✅ `/health` returns 200 status
- ✅ Reports available modes (concise, balanced, deep)
- ✅ Correctly reports `graph_loaded: true`

### 2. Vector Answer Mode
- ✅ Intent routing to vector-only mode
- ✅ Mock OpenAI client integration
- ✅ Chunk retrieval and ranking
- ✅ Answer generation with citations
- ✅ Response normalization to `AskResponse` schema

### 3. Knowledge Graph Loading
- ✅ Loads 938 nodes from `data/kg/master_knowledge_graph.json`
- ✅ Loads 1,639 edges with type attributes
- ✅ Builds `by_id` index (938 entries)
- ✅ Builds `name_index` with 3,183 aliases
- ✅ Constructs NetworkX MultiDiGraph

### 4. KG Data Structure
- ✅ Nodes have required fields: `id`, `type`, `name`
- ✅ Edges have `type` attribute
- ✅ Node count matches `by_id` entries
- ✅ Name index correctly maps normalized names to node IDs

### 5. Integration Points
- ✅ Settings validation with environment variables
- ✅ Graph artifact caching (`@lru_cache`)
- ✅ Dependency injection (client, graph artifacts)
- ✅ Error handling (graceful degradation)

## 🛠️ Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Import-Time Side Effects Removed
**Problem:** `ekg_core/core.py` tried to load KG at import time with hardcoded paths.

**Fix:** Removed the notebook-exported execution block that ran on import.

```python
# BEFORE: Had global execution at module level
with open(os.path.join(BASE_FOLDER, "master_knowledge_graph.json"), "r") as f:
    KG = json.load(f)
# This crashed on import if file didn't exist

# AFTER: Clean library module with no side effects
# Loading is done on-demand by API layer
```

### 2. Export Directory Fixed
**Problem:** `export_markdown()` tried to write to read-only `/content` path.

**Fix:** Updated to use environment variable or local `outputs/` directory.

```python
# BEFORE:
def export_markdown(final, question, save_dir="/content/drive/MyDrive/..."):

# AFTER:
def export_markdown(final, question, save_dir=None):
    if not save_dir:
        save_dir = os.getenv("EKG_EXPORT_DIR") or os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "outputs")
```

### 3. KG Loader Implementation
**Problem:** Placeholder loader didn't handle the actual JSON format.

**Fix:** Implemented full loader with index building.

```python
# Loads nodes and edges from JSON
# Builds by_id index for O(1) node lookup
# Builds name_index with normalized names for fuzzy matching
# Constructs NetworkX graph with proper edge attributes
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Covered Components
- ✅ `api/main.py` - FastAPI endpoints and KG loader
- ✅ `api/settings.py` - Configuration validation
- ✅ `agents/ekg_agent.py` - Agent orchestration
- ✅ `agents/tools/*` - Intent routing and extraction tools
- ✅ `ekg_core/core.py` - Hybrid answer logic (partial)

### Not Yet Covered
- ⏳ Full hybrid KG+vector pipeline (requires real vector store)
- ⏳ OpenAI API integration (using mocks)
- ⏳ Graph expansion algorithms (needs more unit tests)
- ⏳ MMR ranking and chunk reranking
- ⏳ Answer formatting post-processing

## 📈 Future Testing Priorities

1. **Integration Tests with Real Vector Store**
   - Test full hybrid pipeline end-to-end
   - Validate answer quality and citations

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Graph traversal speed (BFS with 2 hops)
   - Index lookup performance
   - Answer generation latency

3. **Load Tests**
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Cache effectiveness
   - Memory usage under load

4. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Empty KG
   - Missing vector store
   - Malformed questions
   - Unicode handling

5. **Security Tests**
   - API key validation
   - Input sanitization
   - Rate limiting

## ✨ Test Quality Metrics

- **Test Count:** 6 tests
- **Pass Rate:** 100%
- **Coverage:** ~60% (estimated, focusing on critical paths)
- **Execution Time:** ~2 seconds
- **Flakiness:** 0 (deterministic with mocks)

## 📝 Notes

- All tests use mocked OpenAI client (no API calls)
- Tests are isolated (no shared state)
- Environment variables set via pytest fixtures
- KG loaded once and cached for performance
- Temporary outputs cleaned up automatically
